## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a flaw in the A.N.V.I.L. logic (e.g., a way to bypass the Physics T1 check), please do NOT open a public issue.

1.  Email the maintainer directly.
2.  Include a "Proof of Concept" system description that passes the audit despite being unsafe.

We will acknowledge receipt within 48 hours.
